## Homebrewed Treap for testing Time & Space Complexity
##### C++ (Spring 2022)

This is a project I did for my Data Structures class called myTreap.

I coded a Treap structure and ran tests for time and space complexity
against a Trie structure created by a fellow student.

main.cpp - driver code for all structure tests

MyTreap.cpp - implementation for my treap

MyTreap.hpp - includes for my treap

Trie.cpp - implementation for my colleague's Trie

Trie.hpp - includes for my colleague's Trie

Complexity_Recorder.hpp - Class provided by my professor for holding test data

Complexity_Timer.hpp - Timer class provided by my professor. serves as a stopwatch
