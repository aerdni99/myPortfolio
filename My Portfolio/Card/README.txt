Java (spring 2022)

This is the first and only experience I have so far coding in Java.

The task was to make a list and populate it with all 52 playing cards.
Shuffle the deck, then sort by rank, and lastly sort by suit and rank.

App.java - contains all of the functions manipulating and outputting the deck

Card.java - contains implementation of my card class
